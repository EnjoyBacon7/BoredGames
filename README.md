# BoredGames

A personal project and game written in python

## Installation

### Windows

run ```python â€“version``` to check if python is installed and if it is up to date. At the time time of writing this (30/06/2023) latest python version is 3.11
If python is not installed you may run ```python``` to open the microsoft store and download python from there.

Now run ```python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user``` and verify pygame is installed with ```python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens```. (I did not make the game)
